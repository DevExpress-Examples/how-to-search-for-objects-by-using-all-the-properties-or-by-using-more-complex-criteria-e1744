' Developer Express Code Central Example:
' How to search for objects by using all the properties or by using more complex criteria
' 
' This example provides a possible workaround for the suggestion. The
' Dennis.Search.Win module, shown in the example, provides API to create a
' non-persistent object that can be used to search by properties of a business
' class. Such a non-persistent search-object should implement the ISearchObject
' contract. By default, it's supported by the abstract and generic
' SearchObjectBase class in the module. Search-objects are shown in a Detail View
' with the help of the SearchObjectViewController. To compose a search criteria, a
' specific SearchObjectPropertyEditor is used (it contains the Search and Clear
' buttons). An example use of the implemented module is illustrated in the
' WinSolution.Module.Win module. There is a ProductSearchObject class that is
' inherited from the base SearchObjectBase class. If necessary, you can create
' several search objects for one business class. In UI, all search objects will be
' listed in a drop-down list in the toolbar of a View of your business class.
' Download and run the attached example to see how this works in action. (Take
' special note of the SearchObjectBase class implementation, because it
' asynchronously loads search results of a specific type from the data store into
' the Search Results nested List View.) See Also:
